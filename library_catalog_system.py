Library Catalog System
Activity 230609 - Demonstrates OOP principles (encapsulation, classes, methods)

ACTIVITY ASSIGNMENT BELOW
================================================================================
230609 - Main Activity
Activity 1: Building a Library Catalog System
Objective: Implement a library catalog system using encapsulation principles.

Instructions:
Define a class called Book with the following attributes and methods:
Attributes:
- title : The title of the book.
- author: The author of the book.
- publication_year: The year the book was published.
- is_available: Indicates whether the book is available for borrowing.

Methods:
- __init__(self, title, author, publication_year): Initializes the book object with the given title, author, and publication year. Set is_available to True by default.
- get_title(self): Returns the title of the book.
- get_author(self): Returns the author of the book.
- get_publication_year(self): Returns the publication year of the book.
- is_book_available(self): Returns the availability status of the book.
- borrow_book(self): Marks the book as borrowed (sets is_available to False).
- return_book(self): Marks the book as returned (sets is_available to True).

Create a list called library to store the book objects.

Implement the following functionality in the main program:
  1. Prompt the user to enter book details (title, author, publication year).
  2. Create a Book object with the provided details and add it to the library list.
  3. Repeat the above step to add multiple books to the library.
  4. Display the available books in the library.
  5. Prompt the user to choose a book to borrow by entering its index.
     - If the chosen book is available, mark it as borrowed and display a success message. Otherwise, display an error message.
  6. Display the available books in the library again.
  7. Prompt the user to choose a book to return by entering its index.
     - If the chosen book is not available, mark it as returned and display a success message. Otherwise, display an error message.
  8. Display the available books in the library one final time.

Note: You can use the input() function to get user input and the print() function to display messages and book information.

Grading:
    First 1-10 submission without errors --> 100 points
    Second 11-20 submission without errors --> 90 points
    Third 21-30 submission without errors --> 85
    the rest without errors --> 80
    Late submission or submission with error --> 60
================================================================================
Implementing a Library Catalog System - a console-based application that demonstrates:
  1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Creating and using a Book class
  2. Encapsulation - Using getter methods to access private attributes
  3. CRUD Operations - Create (add books), Update (borrow/return), Read (display books)
  4. Menu-driven Interface - User interaction via numbered choices
  5. Input Validation - Error handling for invalid inputs and out-of-range indices
  6. Collection Management - Storing objects in a list and manipulating them

This is a practical exercise for learning:
  1. Class design and instantiation
  2. Method creation and calling
  3. List operations with custom objects
  4. User input handling in Python
  5. Basic error handling (try-except)
